# BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator is a simple mobile application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height measurements. It allows users to adjust sliders to input their weight and height, and then calculates their BMI. The app also visually represents the BMI category using different colors.

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on weight and height inputs using UI sliders.
- Provides a numerical BMI value and corresponding BMI category.
- Color representation for different BMI categories: overweight (red), underweight (blue), and normal (green).
- Supports both imperial (pounds and feet) and metric (kilograms and meters) measurement units.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.
